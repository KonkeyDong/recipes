# "Perfect Instant Pot" Butter Chicken Curry

## Ingredients

- **1.75 - 2 Lbs.** boneless, skinless chicken thighs _cut into bite-size pieces_ (try not to exceed 2.5 Lbs. or the curry will end up bland)
- **4 Tablespoons** (half a stick) of butter or _ghee_
- **1 large yellow or white onion**, peeled and diced
- **8-10 cloves of garlic**, minced (**DO NOT SKIP!!**)
- **2 Tablespoons** of **fresh** grated ginger (**DO NOT SKIP!! DO NOT USE POWDER!!**)
- **1 Tablespoon** of curry powder
- **2 Teaspoons** of [garam masala](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-garam-masala-995690) (check in the spice section)
- **1 Teaspoon** of salt
- **3/4 Teaspoon** of paprika
- **15 Ounces** [tomato sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Hunts-Tomato-Sauce-15-oz/dp/B000Q3PPD8)
- **1 cup / 8 Ounces** of heavy cream
- Chopped cilantro for garnish; optional.

## Instructions

1. Place the butter, chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and all spices in the Instant Pot. Set on Sauté for 5 minutes. Stir to make sure the ingredients don't burn. Once the onions are soft, turn off.

1. Pour 1/2 cup water into the pot. Then use a wooden spoon to scrub the debris off the bottom of the pot. (This ensures the burn notice will not go off!)

1. Add the chopped chicken thighs and canned tomato sauce. Lock the lid into place and turn the Instant Pot on Pressure Cook High for 7 minutes. Once finished, turn the Instant Pot Off, then perform a Quick Release to release the steam pressure. Once the valve button drops, unlock the lid and remove.

1. Stir in the heavy cream. Set the Instant Pot on Sauté again and simmer for 2 minutes to thicken the sauce. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve with [seasoned basmati rice](../stovetop_rice/README.md).

## Notes

**Don't have an Instant Pot?** You can make this recipe in the slow cooker! Follow step 1 on the stove top, then transfer the onions and spices to a slow cooker. Add the tomato sauce and chopped chicken. Cover and **slow cook for 6-8 hours on low**. Then stir in the cream and serve.
