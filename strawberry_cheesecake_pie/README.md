## INGREDIENTS

### Base
- **1** [pre-made pie crust](https://www.amazon.com/Keebler-Ready-Crust-Cracker-No-Bake/dp/B000AY9UF2) or from scratch -- 9 Ounces or 250 grams by weight
- **1 package** (8 Ounces) of [cream cheese](https://www.amazon.com/KRAFT-PHILADELPHIA-CREAM-CHEESE-ORIGINAL/dp/B00CBVAHOA)
- **2 Large Eggs**
- **3 Tablespoons** of honey (I just eyeball since I hate measuring honey)
- **1 Teaspoon** of vanilla extract
- **1** [package of strawberries](https://www.target.com/p/strawberries-1lb-package/-/A-13208903) (about 1 Pound or 450 grams, by weight)

### Glaze
(Ratio: 1 part cornstarch : 8 parts water : 8 parts strawberry jam)
- **1 Tablespoon** (15 ml) of cornstarch
- **1/2 Cup** of [strawberry preserves or strawberry jam](https://www.smuckers.com/products/fruit-spreads/preserves/strawberry-preserves)
- **1/2 Cup** of water

## Instructions
### Base
- Place pie crust into oven at 350° Fahrenheit (about  175° to 180° Celsius) for 13 - 15 minutes
- While crust is baking, place cream cheese, eggs, honey, and vanilla extract into bowl and beat until smooth.
- Pour batter into crust immediately when taken out of the oven; place back into oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until center is almost set or when yellow spots begin to form around the edge. You should be able to see what I mean.
- Let pie cool completely on wire rack. I usually wait about 1 hour.

### Glaze
(I prefer chunky strawberries, so I quarter the strawberries when cutting, but this is completely up to you.)
- Cut strawberries; arrange over pie filling. (I say you bought enough strawberries if it covers the top of the pie)
- Combine cornstarch, strawberry jam, and water in a saucepan and stir until smooth.
- Bring glaze to boil, stirring constantly.
- Once boiling, set a timer for 2 minutes. Continue to stir the glaze and keep the heat on for those 2 minutes!
- Once 2 minutes has elapsed, turn off the heat; pour glaze directly over strawberries. Spread the glaze out with the back of a spoon. It should just barely glaze the entire top of the pie.
- Refrigerate for about 2 hours to set the glaze. The glaze will somewhat turn into a kinda of jello consistency.
