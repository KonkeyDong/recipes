## Instructions
1. Mix together 1 ounce of the panko with 2 ounces of the Parmesan in a small bowl. Set aside.

1. Combine the chicken, the egg, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the rest of the panko, the rest of the parmesan, the basil, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, and salt in a large bowl. Using your hands, gently combine until just incorporated, trying not to overwork the meat.

1. Divide the meatball mixture in small 1 ounce balls. Roll each meatball in the panko and parmesan mixture.

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Heat more olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Brown the meatballs in the oil on all sides, working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Remove the browned meat from the pan, place into an oven-safe casserole dish, and top with the jar of marinara. 

1. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and place in the oven. Bake until the meatballs are cooked through and register at least 165F on an instant read thermometer (about 45 minutes). Serve over the top of cooked pasta or on top of crispy bread.
