# Honey Sriracha Chicken

## Ingredients

### Ingredients

* **1 Tablespoon** olive oil
* **1 - 1.5 Pounds** of chicken breast, cut into 1-inch pieces
* **2 Large Eggs**
* **1 - 2 Cups** of flour
* **12 Oz.** bag of broccoli, cut up
* **2 Cups** cooked rice (about 1 cup uncooked rice will be about 2 cups cooked. Might need to play around to find out...)

### Sauce

* **1/2 Cup (135 grams)** Ketchup
* **1/2 Cup (140 grams)** Honey
* **1/3 Cup (100 grams)** Sriracha Sauce
* **1/2 Teaspoon** Salt


## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to **425 F**. Add egg and flour to two large separate bowls. Drench chicken in egg, then coat in flour, shaking to get off any extra flour. Grease a non-stick baking sheet with cooking spray then add chicken pieces, leaving a bit of extra room for broccoli at one end. Bake in the oven for **10 minutes**.
1. Meanwhile, cook rice in a rice cooker or according to package directions (you want enough rice for two servings). Chop broccoli florets if using a head of broccoli.
1. Remove chicken from oven and flip, then add broccoli and drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place back in the oven for another **10 minutes**.
1. While everything is finishing cooking, mix together sauce ingredients then microwave for **1 - 2 minutes** or until sauce is slightly thickened. 
1. Remove chicken from oven and toss in sauce to coat.
1. Add all ingredients to meal prep bowls then top with green onions and sesame seeds (optional). Serve and enjoy!
