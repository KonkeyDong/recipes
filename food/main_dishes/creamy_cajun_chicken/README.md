# Creamy Cajun Chicken

This recipe can either be made in a pan or in a pressure cooker. I will be sharing the pressure cooker recipe here, but check the credit at the bottom for the original, pan-fried recipe.

## Ingredients

* **4 boneless skinless Chicken Thighs**
* Salt + Pepper

## Cajun Cream Sauce

* **2 Tbsp.** butter
* **1 Medium** onion, chopped/diced
* **4 Cloves** of garlic, minced
* **1/2 Cup** chicken stock/broth
* **1/2 Cup** Heavy Cream
* **1 Cup** parmesan cheese, shredded
  * Note: the cheese will be plenty salty!
* Juice of half of a lemon (optional)
* Handful of spinach (optional)

## Seasoning for the Sauce

* **1 Tbsp.** Cajun Seasoning
  * Creole seasoning works if you don't have Cajun.
* **1 Tsp.** paprika.
* **1 Tsp.** Red pepper flake.
* **1 Tsp.** Italian seasoning.

## Recipe

1. In a pressure cooker pot set to Saute mode, melt **2 Tbsp.** of butter in the pot.
1. Add the onion and seasonings; saute for 5 minutes while stirring.
1. Add the chicken stock; scrape any bits from the bottom of the pot.
1. Add the parmesan cheese; stir.
1. Add the chicken thighs with salt a pepper on both sides.
   1. Note: the parmesan cheese will be salty; go easy on the salt.
1. Close the pot; set timer for **10 minutes** on **high** pressure.
1. Once the timer goes off, vent the steam; shred the chicken; add the cream and stir.
1. Serve over rice and enjoy.

## Note

1. The chicken will release a lot of liquid. The sauce sort of turns into a soup. The broth goes well for dipping bread.
