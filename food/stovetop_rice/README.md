# Stovetop Rice

---

## Rice / Water Ratio
- 2 parts rice by 3 parts water.
  - I like 200 grams of rice per 300 grams (ml) of water.

---

## Seasonings
- **2 star anise**
- **3 cardomom pods**, slightly cracked. 
  - Avoid opening the pods where the black seeds come out. The flavor is simply too strong and **will** be a turn off.
- **salt & pepper** to taste.

## Recipe

1. Add rice, (**cold**) water, and all seasongs to a pot. Give a good stir. Cover pot.
1. Bring water to a boil.
1. Once the water starts to boil (Note: not a rolling boil), **turn the heat to low and keep the lid on**. Set timer for 10 minutes.
1. Once the timer goes off, turn heat off completely. Set timer for another 10 minutes.
1. Your rice will come out aromatic and perfect. No need for a rice cooker!

## Notes

1. It is optional to wash your rise before cooking. Washing rise will prevent the rice from clumping when you plate it. I personally like my rice a little clumpy.
1. The seasoned rice goes well with my [Butter Chicken Curry](../butter_chicken_curry/README.md) recipe.
1. I use white rice simply because you can buy a 25 pound sack for $12. You can probably use any kind of (white) rice and have a similar outcome, but you'll have to be the judge of that.
