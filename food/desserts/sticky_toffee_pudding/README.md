# Sticky Toffee Pudding

It looks more like a cake, but It's still delicious!

# Ingredients

## Cake

* **8 Ounces** of Medjool Dates, pitted, chopped.
   * If you can't find Medjool Dates, try Prunes instead.
* **1 Cup** of boiling water.
* **1/3 Cup** (5.333 Tablespoons) butter, room temperature.
* **2/3 Cup** light brown sugar, firmly packed.
* **2 Teaspoons** vanilla extract.
* **2 Large Eggs** either directly out of the fridge or room temperature.
* **2 Tablespoons** molasses.
* **1 2/3 Cups** all-purpose flour.
* **1 1/2 Teaspoons** Baking Powder.
* **1 Teaspoon** baking soda.
* **1/4 Teaspoon** salt.

## Toffee Sauce

* **1/2 Cup** heavy whipping cream.
* **1/2 Cup** (1 stick) butter.
* **3/4 Cup** light brown sugar, packed.
* **1 Pinch** of salt.
* **2 Teaspoons** vanilla extract.
* Chopped Walnuts, optional.

# Instructions

## Cake

1. Preheat oven to **350 degrees Fahrenheit**; lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin, ramekins, or an 8" baking dish.
1. Roughly chop the dates and add to a blender or food processor; pour boiling water in with dates; set aside for 5 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, prepare batter: cream together butter and brown sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating with each addition. Add molasses and mix.
1. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; stir into batter about a quarter of the flour mixture a time.
1. Pulse the date mixture in a food processor/blender; pour date mixture into batter (no need to strain) and fold in gently to combine (don't over-mix!).
1. Pour batter into prepared muffin tin or baking dish; bake for **18-20 minutes** or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean or with few crumbs (no raw batter). **Don't overbake or the cake will be dry!**
   1. For square baking pan, bake for **22-25 minutes**.

## Toffee Sauce

1. Add cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt to a saucepan. Cook over **low heat**, stirring until sugar dissolves and sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about **7-10 minutes**.
1. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.

# Notes

* You can store cake and toffee sauce into separate air-tight containers in the fridge for up to 5 days.
* To reheat, simply place in microwave for 30 seconds with sauce.
