## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
1. Combine the cranberries, apple, brown sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and 1 Tsp. of cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside.
1. In a large bowl (electric mixer with paddle attachment makes this easier, but a hand mixer works well), beat eggs on medium-high speed for 2 minutes.
1. Reducer mixer to medium speed and add 1 cup of sugar, melted butter, vanilla, sour cream, and beat just until combined.
1. On low speed, **slowly** add the flour and salt.
1. Pour the fruit mixture evenly into a 10-inch glass pie plate. Pour the batter over the fruit, covering fruit completely. Combine the remaining 1 Tbsp. of sugar and 1/8 Tsp. of cinnamon and sprinkle over the batter.
1. Bake for 55 - 60 minutees or until a toothpick/knife inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean and the fruit is bubbling around the edges. Serve warm or at room temperature. **Note: place a cookie sheet below the pie plate to catch any bubble-over. You'll thank me later.**
