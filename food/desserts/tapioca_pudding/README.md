# Tapioca Pudding

This recipe uses a pressure cooker to hydrate the tapioca pearls in minutes instead of soaking over night.

## Ingredients

* **1/2 cup** Tapioca pearls. I like [Reese Large Pearls](https://reesespecialtyfoods.com/product/large-pearl-tapioca)
* **2 1/2 cups** whole milk
* **1/4 Teaspoon** salt
* **1/2 cup** sugar
* **2 egg yolks**
* **1 teaspoon** vanilla extract
* **1 stick** of cinnamon

## Instructions

For **small pearls**, use **6 minutes on high pressure**. For **large pearls**, use **9 minutes on high pressure**.

1. Place 1/2 cup of tapioca pearls, 1 stick of cinnamon, and 2 cups of water into a pressure cooker and cook for the appropriate amount of time mentioned above, on high pressure. When the timer goes off, **turn off the cooker and let the pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes**. After ten minutes, quick-release the remaining steam.

1. Strain the pearls and water using a sieve. discard the starchy water.

1. Add the pearls, the cinnamon stick from before, salt, vanilla extract, and sugar back to the pressure cooker pot.

1. In a separate bowl, add two egg yolks and poke them. Add the two and one half cups of whole milk and give a quick whisk. Add the custard base to the pot.

1. Turn on `Saute` mode on the pressure cooker. Stir constantly until the milk begins to boil.

1. Once the milk begins to boil, pour the pudding directly into dishes or a pie dish (remove the cinnamon stick). A 9-inch pie dish should the perfect size for the pudding. Chill for several hours until cool. This pudding should thicken as it cools. The consistency won't firm up completely; it should be a little thin after it cools completely.

Optionally serve with whipped cream and fruit.
