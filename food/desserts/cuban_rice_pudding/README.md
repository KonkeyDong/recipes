# Cuban Rice Pudding

##### Note:

**If you don't like Tapioca Pudding, you probably won't like this pudding.**

# Ingredients

* **3/4 Cup** washed short/long grain white rice.
* **2 Cups** water
* **1 Medium Lemon**
   * You will need one quarter of the **lemon's rind** for the recipe -- *not the juice*!
* **2 Sticks** of Cinnamon
* **12 Oz. Can** of Evaporated Milk.
* **14 Oz. Can** Sweetened Condensed Milk.
* **1 Teaspoon** of Vanilla Extract.
* **1/4 Teaspoon** of Salt.
* Additional water, as needed if you like a thinner pudding. Maybe 1/4 Cup?

# Recipe

1. In a saucepan over **medium to medium-high heat**, bring **Rice, Water, Lemon Rind,** and **Cinnamon Sticks** to a boil; reduce heat to **low** and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes or until rice is tender.

1. Once rice is tender, remove lemon rinds.

1. Over low heat, *gradually* add **Evaporated Milk** and **Sweetened Condensed Milk**, stirring constantly to ensure rice does not stick.

1. Add **salt** and **vanilla extract** and stir.

1. Cook and **continue to stir constantly** for **7 to 10 minutes** until mixture thickens to your liking.

1. Remove from heat and allow to cool, maybe about a half hour, before storing in refrigerator in containers, covered. The pudding should thicken quite nicely in the fridge for an hour or two.
