## Recipe

### Mix the dry ingredients

Whisk together the flour, baking soda, ginger, pepper, allspice, salt, and cloves. Set Aside.

### Make the dough

1. In a stand (fitted with a hand attachment) or hand mixer (in a large bowl), beat butter and brown sugar at medium speed until slightly pale (about 1 minute).
1. Add the eggs **one at a time**, beating thoroughly after each addition until fluffy (about 1 minute).
1. Add the molasses, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract and beat until combined.
1. Reduce the mixer speed to low and gradually add the flour mixture, beating just until the last trace of flour disappears. **The dough will be very soft and sticky.**

### Chill the dough

Divide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic, and press into a 6" X 6" square. Refrigerate the dough until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.

### Preheat the oven and prepare the pans

Arrange two oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

### Roll the dough into balls

1. Place the demerara sugar in a small bowl. Remove one square of dough from the refrigerator, portion into 1-ounce (28g) pieces and roll each into a ball (about 1 1/4 inches in diameter).
1. Toss the balls in the demerara sugar to coat all over, then place on the prepared baking sheets, spaced about 3 inches apart (the cookies will spread during baking). Refrigerate any balls that don't fit on the baking sheets.

### Bake

Bake on the upper and lower racks until the edges are firm to the touch but the centers are still very soft and slightly shiny. 12 - 14 minutes, switching racks and rotating the sheets front to back halfway through the cooking.

Remove from oven and cool for 15 minutes on the baking sheets before using a thin spatula to transfer them to a wire rack. Repeat the rolling and baking for the remaining dough.
