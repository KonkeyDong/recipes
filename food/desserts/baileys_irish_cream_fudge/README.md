# Bailey's Irish Cream Fudge

## Ingredients

* **4 1/2 Cups** of white granulated sugar.
* **1 Can (12 Oz.)** Evaporated Milk.
* **1/2 Lbs.** of butter.
* **2 Packages** of milk chocolate chips.
* **1 Package** of semi-sweet chocolate chips.
* **2 Jars (7 Oz. each)** of marshmallow cream/fluff.
* **2 Teaspoons** of vanilla extract.
* **2/3 Cup** Bailey's Irish Cream.
* (Optional) **2 Cups** chopped nuts.

## Recipe

I'd recommend a big pot to make the fudge as this recipe will make five pounds!

1. Heat **butter**, **sugar**, & **evaporated milk** over **medium heat** until boils.
1. Once boiling, reduce heat to a **medium-low heat** and cook slowly; **stir for 11 minutes constantly**.
1. Remove pot from heat; **add in rest of ingredients and mix by hand with a wooden spoon**.
   1. The marshmallow fluff, by far, will be the worst to mix in. If necessary, place the pot on a low heat to help melt the marshmallow fluff into the fudge
1. Pour into a buttered **9" X 13" pan** and refrigerate.
1. Store into air-tight containers. The fudge should last for a few weeks in the fridge, or up to three months in the freezer. **Use wax paper to separate the fudge to prevent sticking**.
