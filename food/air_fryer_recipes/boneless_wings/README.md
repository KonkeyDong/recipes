# Ingredients

* 8 oz. boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts (I prefer thighs as they have better flavor)
* Some sort of sauce, such as a BBQ sauce, or a Buffalo Wild Wings sauce, such as [Asian Zing](https://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Wild-Wings-Sauce-Asian/dp/B00CS98L52) sauce
* 1/2 Cup of flour
* 1/4 Teaspoon of salt
* 1/4 Teaspoon of pepper

# Instructions

1. Preheat air-fryer to 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 - 15 minutes.
1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and place in a large bowl.
1. Add your sauce to the chicken and toss around; set aside.
1. In a separate bowl, add the flour, salt, and pepper and mix.
1. Add coated chicken to the flour in batches (avoids clumping; better coating) and toss around; Shake off excess flour and set aside. Continue until all chicken is coated in flour.
1. Add chicken to air fryer. Toss the chicken half way through cooking.
1. Fry to your liking or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
