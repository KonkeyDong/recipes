# Garlicky Almonds

# Recipe

* 1 Tbsp. of soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp. of garlic powder
* 1 Tsp. of paprika
* 1/4 tsp. of pepper
* 2 cups (~300 grams) of **raw almonds**

# Instructions

1. In a large bowl, stir together all of the ingredients, except the almonds, until you have a thick paste. Stir in the almonds, making sure to coat them really well (and really evenly!).

1. Transfer the almonds to your air fryer basket, and cook at 300° F for 6-8 minutes, shaking every 2 minutes to prevent sticking and so that they'll cook evenly.

1. Starting at minute 6, you'll want to check in every minute, tasting an almond for doneness. Your almonds are ready when they have hardened a bit but are still a little chewy in the center. They will get crunchier once they’re cooled. Trust me: I have burnt roasted nuts before, because I was waiting for them to get crunchy all the way through. Don’t be like me!

1. Let them cool to room temperature – about 10-15 minutes – then transfer to your storage container of choice.
