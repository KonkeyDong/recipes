# Beef Jerky

# Recipe

* **10-12 Oz.** sirloin steak (or any kind of lean beef)
* **1 clove** of garlic (or **1 Tsp.** garlic paste)
* **1 inch** of fresh ginger root, peeled and grated
* **2 Tbsp.** soy sauce (do not use reduced sodium variety as we need high salt to kill surface bacteria)
* **1 Tbsp.** sugar (brown, white, turbinado, etc.. I personally avoid imitation sugar, such as Splenda.)
* **1 Tbsp.** chili paste (such as [Sambai Oelek](https://www.amazon.com/Huey-Fong-Sambal-Oelek-Chili/dp/B00VEIR5VE/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=sambal%2Boelek&qid=1644106732&sr=8-1&th=1))
* **1 Tbsp.** rice vinegar

# Instructions

1. Pour marinade into container, seal and place in the refrigerator for **at least 4 or up to 24 hours**.
