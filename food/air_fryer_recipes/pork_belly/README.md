# Air-Fried Pork Belly

## Ingredients

* **1 Portion (4-8 Oz.)** of pork belly
* **Chinese All-Spice**
* **Salt/Pepper** to taste
* (Optional) **BBQ Sauce** (or any kind of sauce).
* **High Smoke Point** cooking oil, such as **Avocado Oil**
   * You want to make sure the oil you use will smoke at a temperature above **400 degrees F** or you'll risk setting off the smoke alarm. **Avocado Oil** has a smoke point of **550 F degrees**.
   
## Recipe

1. Lay the piece of pork belly out on the counter for *twenty minutes*.
1. Pre-heat your air-fryer to **320 degrees F**.
1. Score the fat side of the pork belly in a diamond pattern.
1. Add about a teaspoon or more of **Avocado Oil** to the top side of the pork belly and massage the oil into the meat; sprinkle the **chinese all-spice** all over the top and massage into the meat.
1. Flip the meat over and repeat the oil and all-spice coating.
1. Place the pork belly onto some tin foil **with the fat side up**; fold the tin foil around the sides of the belly. **Leave the top of the belly exposed**. 
   * This step is to catch all the fat that renders off of the meat so you have less mess to clean up.
1. Once the meat is covered on all four sides, place into the pre-heated oven; **set timer for 30 minutes**.
1. Once the timer goes off, set the temperature of the oven to **390 degrees F** and **cook for another five minutes**.
1. Remove meat from oven and serve with a sauce, if desired.
