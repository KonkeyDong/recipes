# Salmon

## Ingredients

* **~6 Ounce** Salmon filet with skin.
* Salt, Pepper, Garlic, and Onion Powder.
* Avocado Oil or Butter
* Cooking Spray
* Aluminum Foil

## Recipe

1. Preheat Air-Fryer to **390 Fahrenheit**, timer for **11 Minutes**.
1. Take Salmon filet and rub Avocado Oil or melted butter onto the flesh and skin.
1. Sprinkle **Salt**, **Pepper**, **Garlic**, and **Onion Powder** on **both sides of the filet**.
1. Spray some cooking spray on some aluminum foil; set Salmon filet **skin-side down on the foil**.
   1. Don't worry about folding the foil *tightly* around the filet, but make sure you make a pocket to contain the oil. Otherwise, the oil will get all over the basket area.
1. When the Air-Fryer is preheated, place the Salmon filet with the aluminum foil into the basket; set timer for **11 minutes**, if you haven't already.
1. The salmon is fully cooked if the internal temperature in the thickest part of the filet reads at least **145 Fahrenheit**. The filet should be slightly crispy when cut with a fork or knife.
1. Serve with any excess melted butter or any sauce you have on hand and serve on a bed of rice and enjoy!
