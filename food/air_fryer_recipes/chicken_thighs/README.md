# Chicken Thighs

## Ingredients

* **Bone-in w/ skin** chicken thighs
* **Seasoning**. I like [Dan O's original](https://danosseasoning.com/).
* Pam cooking spray

## Recipe

1. Pre-heat oven to **375 degrees Fahrenheit** for **10 minutes**.
1. While the oven is pre-heating, take a paper towel and remove any moisture from the chicken on both sides.
1. **Generously** cover both sides of the chicken with your seasoning; shake off any excess.
1. Once the oven is pre-heated, spray the basket with cooking spray.
1. Place the chicken thigh **skin-side down**.
1. Once the timer goes off, flip the chicken so that it is **skin-side up**; set temperature to **375 degrees Fahrenheit** and set timer for **11 minutes**.
1. Serve and enjoy. The chicken should be extremely juicy and the seasoning should make the skin nice and crispy.
   * There may be some red/blood in the chicken. This is edible and shouldn't harm you.
