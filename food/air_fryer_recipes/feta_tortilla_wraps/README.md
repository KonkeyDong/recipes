# Feta Tortilla Wraps

## Ingredients

* **1/4 Cup (about 2 Ounces)** of Feta cheese, crumbled.
* **1 Tablespoon** of Sun Dried Tomatoes.
   * Look for a jar that contains oil for extra flavor!
   * Add as much or as little as you want.
* **1 10 Inch** Flour Tortilla.
* **1 Egg**, beaten.
* **1 Teaspoon** of Sesame Seeds.
   * Use as little or as much as you want.
* **Honey**

## Recipes

1. Pre-heat Air Fryer to **360 degrees Fahrenheit**.
1. Take an egg and crack into a bowl and whisk. Set aside.
1. Take Tortilla and place on a plate; add Feta Cheese and Sun Dried Tomatoes with some of the oil from the jar.
1. Wrap up tortilla by folding the left side over the right side, and then wrap the tops and bottoms over the fold and flip up-side-down so that the wrap doesn't unfold. It should be a sealed tortilla pocket.
1. Brush beaten egg on the top of the tortilla.
1. Sprinkle on some Sesame Seeds.
1. Cook in the Air Fryer for **9 - 11 Minutes** or until desired brownness. 11 Minutes I found melts the Feta very nicely.
1. Remove from Air Fryer; drizzle honey over the top of the tortillas.
   1. The honey helps counter the flavor of the Feta; it's up to you to decide how much Honey to add.
