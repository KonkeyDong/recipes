# Recipe

## For the Apples

1. Wash and peel the apples. Cut them in half and remove the cores. Cut into thin slices (1/8 to 1/4 inch thick).
1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 Tablespoon of butter and add the apples.
1. Sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar over the top of the apples and stir. Cook until the sugar has reduced and the apples have become soft, about 10 minutes.

## Other Fruit

Follow the directions for apples above, but omit the cinnamon. Frozen fruit works well.

## For the Oatmeal Bake

1. Preheat the oven to **375 F**.
1. In a large bowl, mix together the oats and baking powder.
1. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, protein powder, and melted 1 Tablespoon of melted butter. (**Try using a shaker bottle!**)
1. Add the cooked apples to the oatmeals and stir.
1. Pour the liquid on the oats and apples and stir.
1. Spray a 13" X 9" baking dish with oil and add the oat mixture and apples.
1. Bake for 30 - 35 minutes. Cut into 6 pieces (don't remove from the baking dish) and cool completely by placing into the fridge with tin foil over the top.
1. Add the vanilla yogurt on top and spread around with a spoon. Add a honey drizzle over the top, if you wish.
