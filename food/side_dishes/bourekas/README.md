# Bourekas

## Spinach, Ricotta, Puff Pastry, Everything Bagel Seasonings

# Ingredients

* 1/2 pound spinach (sauteed in olive oil and with a pinch of salt)
* 2 sheets puff pastry (12 X 12 is ideal)
* 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* Zest and juice of 1 lemon
* 2 Eggs
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. Black Pepper
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 Tbsp. water
* 3 Tbsp. Everything bagel seasoning (even amounts of poppy seed, sesame seed, black sesame seed, minced dried onion, minced dried garlic)

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
1. Wilt spinach in a saute pan and set aside to cool. Once cooled, wring spinach out in a towel to get rid of excess water.
1. In a bowl or mixer, combine the cooked spinach with the cheese, lemon, 2 eggs, salt and pepper. Take the puff pastry and cut into 4 X 4 pieces. Place a tablespoon of the cheese filling in the center of each piece of puff. Fold from corner to corner to seal the boureka. If they don't seal, wet your finger with water and run it along the edge to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork if you are concerned about the seal.
1. Mix yolks and water. Brush the bourekas with the egg wash. Sprinkle with everything bagel seasoning.
1. Spray or rub a baking sheet with pan spray or olive oil. Bake for roughly 30 minutes or until golden brown.
