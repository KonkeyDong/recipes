# No-Knead Dough

# Ingredients

* **3 1/2 Cups** of All-Purpose or Bread flour, plus more for dusting.
* **Generous 1/4 Teaspoon** of instant yeast.
* **2 Teaspoons** kosher salt
* **1 1/2 Cups** water
* Cornmeal, wheat bran, of flour to prevent sticking to surfaces.

# Instructions

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add **1Â½ cups/345 grams** water and stir until blended; dough should come together and be sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.
   * If the dough didn't come together into a solid mass and isn't sticky, try adding **1 Teaspoon** of water to the dough and try mixing. Continue adding **1 Teaspoon** of water until all of the dough comes together and is sticky.

1. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Place some parchment paper (makes cleanup easier) and lightly flour the surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour. Looking at the dough, take the left and right sides and fold them towards the middle. Repeat once more, but with the top and bottom sides. Cover loosely with parchment paper and let **rest about 15 minutes**.

1. Generously coat some parchment paper with **flour, wheat bran or cornmeal**; put dough seam side down on parchment paper and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and **let rise for about 2 hours**. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

1. **At least a half-hour before dough is ready**, place a dutch oven (cast iron, enamel, pyrex, or ceramic) with the lid into the oven and begin heating oven to **450 degrees** (do not preheat the oven first and then add a cold dutch oven into the oven. Both the oven and the dutch oven need to increase in temperature together or you risk cracking your dutch oven.). When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Remove the top piece of parchment paper and pick up the bread dough by the parchment paper and place directly into the dutch oven; it may look like a mess, but that is OK since the dough straightens out as it bakes. **Cover with lid and bake 30 minutesK**, then **remove lid and bake another 10 to 30 minutes**, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.
