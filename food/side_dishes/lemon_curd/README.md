# Recipe

1. Add **Eggs and Egg Yoks** to a sauce pan and mix well.
1. Add **Butter, Sugar, and Lemon Juice + Zest** to the sauce pan and mix well.

1. Once the butter completely melts, **keep the heat on and set a timer for 8 minutes** or until the curd is to a desired consistancy. You should be able to dip a wooden spoon into the curd and swipe down the middle and see the two sides remain on the spoon (see youtube video below).
